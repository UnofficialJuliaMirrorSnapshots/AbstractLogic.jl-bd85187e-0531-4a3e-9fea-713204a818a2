# AbstractLogic Source Code

## main
Houses the majority of functional code such as definition of logical set. Functions for parsing string commands.

## repl
Houses the code related to interacting with the repl. Many functions mirror function found in the main as they tend to have different screen printing features to those found in main. The repl primarily interacts with a `let block` which stores the values used when interacting with the repl.
