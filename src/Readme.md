# AbstractLogic Source Code

## main
Houses the majority of functional code such as definition of logical set, functions for commands input as strings, the ability to set solution space, as well as the ability to set contraints on that space.

## repl
Houses the code related to interacting with the repl. Many functions mirror function found in the main as they tend to have different screen printing features to those found in main. The repl primarily interacts with a `let block` which stores the values used when interacting with the repl.
